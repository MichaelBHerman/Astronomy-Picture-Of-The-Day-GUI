# Astronomy-Picture-Of-The-Day-GUI
A program I created that uses the NASA APOD API and displays the image, title, date, and explanation in a Java Swing GUI.  Prev/Next buttons are integrated for browsing images.
OKHttp is used to Handle HTTP GET requests and responses from the NASA APOD API.
Jackson is used to parse JSON response into a POJO.
Review the POM.XML for the previously mentioned dependendcies.
