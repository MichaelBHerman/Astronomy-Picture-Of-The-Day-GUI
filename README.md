# Astronomy-Picture-Of-The-Day-GUI
A program I created that uses the NASA APOD API and displays the image, title, date, and explanation in a Java Swing GUI. Prev/Next buttons are integrated for browsing images. OKHttp is used to Handle HTTP GET requests and responses from the NASA APOD API. Jackson is used to parse JSON response into a POJO. Review the POM.XML for the previously mentioned dependendcies.
